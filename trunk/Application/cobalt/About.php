		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cobalt is a web-based code generator and framework using PHP and Oracle Database, created by JV Roig. <br><br>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a code generator, so it is capable of producing a complete working system
		based on the information you feed it (data dictionary and a few miscellaneous data for
		certain special cases).<br><br>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also a framework. This means it contains functions that allow you to create
		applications much easier and faster than if you were to start from scratch.<br><br>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cobalt was previously known as "SCV2". The name "SCV2" stands for "SYNERGY Core, Version 2", 
		as it was originally
		intended to be a much-needed improvement to the original SYNERGY Core which JV 
		made circa 2005-2006. But as he worked on it, it started to become a lot more than just
		an overhaul of the SYNERGY Core, eventually becoming the code generator and
		framework that it is now.<br><br>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The basic idea behind Cobalt is this: redundant development tasks (like creating
		"add/edit/delete/view" modules) should be done automatically so that we can have more
		efficient use of our time. Instead of spending 70% of our time working on redundant
		parts of the system, we should just spend a minimal amount of time on them by letting a
		code generator do most of the redundant work for us. This way, we focus most of our
		energies on the really important parts of system development: the system design, special
		modules, and the reports.<br><br>
